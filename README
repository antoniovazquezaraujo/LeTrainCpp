Letrain (The Letter Train Simulator)
Letrain is a train simulator made only with letters.
Is an object oriented project writed in C++, for curses terminals 
with extensive use of stl containers and a little language 
(using boost Spirit) for map and events description.
You can design infinite maps in real time crossing and forking rails 
automatically while the trains are moving around.
You can place sensors and semaphores to programs fork changes and
locomotive speeds and directions.
The train movement is influenced by the number of wagons pulled or
pushed, and it can detect train crashes.
